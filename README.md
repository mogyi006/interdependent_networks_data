# interdependent_networks_data

This repository contains network files, disaster data, and extended figures related to the research on disaster-resilient interdependent networks using machine learning.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on enhancing the resilience of interdependent networks, specifically communication and power networks, during disaster events. The research investigates how the interdependency between these networks affects their overall resilience and proposes methods to improve their robustness against failures. Using machine learning, particularly graph neural networks (GNNs), this project aims to predict interdependencies and optimize network upgrades cost-effectively.

## Contents

- **Network Files**: Contains the network models used in the simulations, including both communication and power networks.
- **Disaster Data**: Includes real disaster data, particularly earthquakes, used for evaluating the models and methods.
- **Extended Figures**: Provides additional figures and visualizations supporting the research findings.

## Key Methods

- **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)**: Used for predicting the interdependencies between network components based on historical failure data.
- **Heuristic Methods**: Developed for network operators to enhance the disaster resilience of their networks in a cost-efficient manner.
- **Simulation**: Real-world networks and earthquake data are used to validate the models and methods, demonstrating significant improvements in network resilience.
